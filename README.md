I face problem So i create this.
## AjayMonitorForArduino

AjayMonitorForArduino is a custom-made serial monitor designed specifically for microcontrollers like Arduino, ESP32, ESP8266, and STM32. It simplifies the process of monitoring readings from sensors, aiding in code calibration and workflow management. 

## Features

- **Custom Serial Monitor**: Provides a dedicated serial monitor for microcontrollers, facilitating easy monitoring of sensor readings.
- **Data Logging**: Saves readings in .txt format for further analysis.
- **Support for Multiple Platforms**: Compatible with various microcontroller platforms including Arduino, ESP32, ESP8266, and STM32.
- **Easy Setup**: Just specify the port (e.g., COM5, COM7) according to your PC and start reading.
- **Additional Tools**: Includes a texttocsv.exe application for converting data to .csv format, enhancing data analysis capabilities.

## Why AjayMonitorForArduino?

Arduino IDE lacks certain features like easy data copying and pasting due to token size limitations. AjayMonitorForArduino addresses this issue by providing a dedicated serial monitor solution tailored for microcontroller applications.

## Usage

1. Specify the port (e.g., COM5, COM7) according to your PC.
2. Start monitoring readings from connected sensors.
3. Press the "u" button to close the application and automatically save data.
4. Utilize the texttocsv.exe tool for converting data to .csv format for further analysis.

## Note

- This tool was initially created for personal use and may require adjustments for universal application.
- Updates for a universal texttocsv.exe tool are planned for the future.

## Demo

Check out the demonstration of the monitor app and texttocsv.exe tool in action.
